                <h2>Camera</h2>
                <p>When you start looking into what type of gear you need to shoot your own videos, it becomes all too
                    easy to wind up in a rabbit hole of amazing cameras and equipment. Even when on a budget, it’s
                    tempting to want to spend big bucks to invest in the best gear possible.
                    You don’t need to fork out thousands of pounds on “the best” camera
                    equipment to make a good video. It’s actually never been more affordable to create stunning images
                    on the cheap, and there’s more to a good-looking video than just the camera you use.
                    Here are some affordable alternatives to traditional video equipment:
                    Your Phone – It’s possible to shoot high-quality footage entirely on your phone,
                    especially if you have a phone made within the last 3 years, it’s a perfect fit if your on a very
                    tight budget.
                    DSLR Cameras – if you want a more professional look a DlSR is a perfect place to start. The last
                    couple
                    generations of DSLRs from Canon, Nikon, and more have had amazing video quality, and are still very
                    popular with indie filmmakers. There are plenty of affordable DSLRs like the Nikon 1576 D5600, the
                    Canon EOS 70D, and more under $1,000.
                    Low-Light Cameras – Low-light cameras have special sensors that help them take in more information
                    with less light. This means you can spend less time and money on expensive lighting. The <span>
                        LUMIX GH4</span> is a great low-light camera on the affordable side. On the expensive side,
                    there’s the
                    absolutely fantastic A7s 3.
                    Mirrorless cameras - are taking over the market. its a fairly new techonolgy which rids of the
                    traditional lens system built on mirrors and relection it adds a digital sense which prints the
                    image direct to the sensor. this new technology enables a number of new posibilites one of them
                    being slightly cheaper than the full blown cinema camera...

                <h2>Accessories</h2>
                <p> When it comes to accessories you have to be very careful there are some essentials which you cant do
                    without, equally there re some non essentials which you may have to avoide even if the price is
                    tempting.Tripods are one of the important ones, which is why it’s always good to do your
                    research. Focusing specifically on Tripods for DSLRs, one of the best under $100 is the BONFOTO 671A
                    Travel Aluminum Camera Tripod, or the AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod. You can always stack
                    some books on a table. if you want something alot more portable and smaller a small gorrilla pod can
                    handle both a phone and a camera, these can be hung all around very useful for a budget shoot.
                    If you want even cheaper, hey you could always stack books or stack anything forthat matter.. just
                    make sure its stable.
                    Gimble– Creating steady footage is a vital part of creating your own videos, but there are
                    all kinds of steadicam rig options available. Some cheap ones include these $79 and $159 ones from
                    Glide Gear. However, there’s actually a bunch of creative options for creating your own DIY
                    steadicam rig. Check out a few, like the PVC stabilizer, Silver Flyer, Dual Shoulder rig.
                    Lens – When shooting with DSLRs, the lenses are what you’re actually paying for. That’s why we
                    recommend renting a lens package instead of buying your own. These rentals can still be expensive,
                    so evaluate if you’ll be shooting enough content that it makes more sense to buy your own lens. If
                    you are looking to buy your own, Lifewire has a great list of the best here.

                <h2>Natural light</h2>
                <p>The best way to get around lighting is to shoot during the day. The sun is free. this helps to
                    eliminate any issues you may with too little light but again this starts from the planning stage</p>
                <h2>Lighting</h2>
                <p>Thanks to the magic of LED, lighting kits are finally both affordable and lightweight for the first
                    time in the history of filmmaking. That doesn’t mean that every LED light kit is cheap, however.
                    With so much variation in lighting setups and lighting styles, there’s no one-size-fits-all for what
                    you’re trying to shoot. this is all regulated in what your are trying to achive, for a high contrast
                    look it best to have single light built around the set this allows you to control how much light you
                    want this allows you to create a very artistic and moody look.
                    now if you want to look more into color and the like it maybe useful to buy filters which attach to
                    most led lights these can be easly found on amazon. this saves money on buying all kind of colored lighting. </p>
