                <h2>Planning</h2>
                <p>Firstly, everything begins with a plan, many times professionals would dedicate more time to planning
                    than the shoot itself.
                    It's great to know what you want to create and most importantly where before you go ahead and
                    create. This includes budgeting, scheduling and location.
                    Writing and planning out your idea ahead of time by making it a script
                    will help you visualize your video’s story. Most importantly, write with things that are easy for
                    you to Shoot.
                    <h2> Team</h2>
                    Be very very smart on who you work with this is either make or break.. if possible work with a small
                    team, this works wonders when you hsve to organise logistics.
                    Plus, you can use individuals in your team to do multiple jobs, from camera work to acting as an
                    extra, use
                    everyone in everyway possible this can immediatly broaden your options during a shoot.
                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    Don’t go out of your way to find some grandiose location to shoot
                    your video just to get some gorgeous B-roll. Shoot your video local, on a location you control that
                    you don’t have to pay anyone to use. if you want a two for one bargain find a location with props,
                    if its indoor use your office where you work or maybe a family members house absolutely anything..
                    trust no one will know..</p>

                <h2>Script</h2>
                <p>Firstly, let’s look at your script. It’s tempting to let your imagination run wild but some stories
                    are cheaper to produce than others.
                    For example, a contemporary drama will most likely cost less than a futuristic sci-fi. If you are
                    going to shoot a high concept film you need to be clever with how you go about this.
                    For instance, take the feature film Monsters (2010) directed by Gareth Edwards. This sci-fi feature
                    is full of CGI elements but cost considerably less than typical features of this genre. This was due
                    to many cost cuts such as hiring a small crew, using public locations and Edwards creating the
                    visual effects himself.If you are a filmmaker writing your screenplay, play to your strengths and
                    use what resources you have access to. Additionally, if you are a producer sourcing a screenplay,
                    consider how many location changes and actors are in the script.
