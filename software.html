                <h2>Do It Yourself</h2>
                <p>first of all if you want to save major bucks, edit yourself, as complicated as it may seem its the
                    best way to save a whle lot of money. many editing services charge for re-edits meaning you may not
                    like the first take and have to pay morwe to get it redu so first things first opt in to edit your
                    material yourself also as a content creator its a great skill to have. theres many tutorials on
                    youtube on how to edit and use the software around these come in handy when stuck on anything.</p>

                <h2>Editing</h2>
                <p>Firstly starts with the memory, files genrated from images and video are extremely large, depending
                    on the length of your project it is recomened you have a couple terabite hardrives. this is hwere
                    the budget can be quite dear, the issue is there is no way around it and the last thing you want is
                    all your footage being lost due to a low quality hardrive. Samgsung make a great one, called the
                    samsung t5, very realible and its small enough to hock on straight to the camera while shooting.</p>
                <h2>Software</h2>
                <p>theres alot of industry leading software but they all come with a price, for the best budget
                    experince its non other than imove. its a preloded software on a macbook very basic and will
                    definalty get the job done. basic transitions and and cutting tools enough to fix up a youtube vlog
                    and the like. For a more professional standard editing including color correction you have final cut
                    x or adobe premier pro these can be extremely price but a happy medium is Davinci resolve, this
                    software can be downloaded for free and it carries great value. You can pretty much edit a project
                    from start to finish including the added perk of color correction. </p>
